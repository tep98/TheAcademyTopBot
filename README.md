# TheAcademyTopBot
## Description
I made this telegram bot to practice at the Top Academy College. However, you can use my code to modify it to suit your needs related **to interacting with xlsx files via the telegram bot.**



# How to Use

**With this bot, you can perform 2 main functions:**
- Counting the number of lessons performed by a group;
- Finding students with an average score below 3.0;

## 1. Installing dependencies
To start using the bot, you should install all the necessary libraries.
You can do this using the terminal in the project directory using the command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

You can also do this manually using the file *requirements.txt*

## 2. Creating telegram bot
Next you need to create your own telegram bot using ```@BotFather``` in telegram

## 3. Paste the token
You need to insert the token of the bot you created into the value of the TOKEN constant variable. Your code use to be like:

```TOKEN = "YOURTOKEN"```


# Important note!
**To use the bot, you will need xlsx files with information about students or lessons.** 
If you are going to use the code for tables with other data, you can simply change the code to suit your tasks.
